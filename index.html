                Nirvana was an American rock band formed by singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987. Nirvana went 
                through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990. Despite releasing only three full-length studio 
                albums in their seven-year career, Nirvana has come to be regarded as one of the most influential and important rock bands of the modern era.
					 In the late 1980s Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album Bleach for the independent record label 
					 Sub Pop in 1989. The band eventually came to develop a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. 
					 After signing to major label DGC Records, Nirvana found unexpected success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit", the first single from the band's second 
					 album Nevermind (1991). Nirvana's sudden success widely popularized alternative rock as a whole, and the band's frontman Cobain found himself referred 
					 to in the media as the "spokesman of a generation", with Nirvana being considered the "flagship band" of Generation X.

								 Nirvana's third and final studio album, In Utero (1993), featured an abrasive, less-mainstream sound and challenged the group's audience. The album did not match the sales figures of Nevermind 
					 		    but was still a critical and commercial success. Nirvana's brief run ended following the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994, but various posthumous releases have been 
					 			 issued since, overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. Since its debut, the band has sold over 25 million records in the United States alone, 
					 			 and over 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists in history. Four of their albums, two studio and two live, have reached the 
					 			 number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart. In the years since the band's breakup, Nirvana has been ranked highly on several lists by various publications as one of 
					 			 the greatest artists of all time. Rolling Stone described Nirvana's influence as having "kicked in" the 1990s as a musical era, adding that their music "guaranteed 
					 			 the nineties would not suck," and claimed that the band "transformed rock for a generation." According to the magazine, "few bands in rock history have had a more 
					 			 immediate and tangible impact on their contemporary pop musical landscape than Nirvana did in the early Nineties." Nirvana is set to be inducted into the Rock and 
					 			 Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, the band's first year of eligibility; the museum's biography of the band states that Nirvana "start[ed] a rock revolution" and "remain an 
					 			 enduring influence and challenge", before declaring them "proof that the right band with the right noise can change the world."

              <strong>Kurt Donald Cobain</strong> (February 20, 1967 – c. April 5, 1994) was an American musician and artist, best known as the lead singer, guitarist and primary songwriter of the grunge 
              band Nirvana. Cobain formed Nirvana with Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1985 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene, having its debut album Bleach 
              released on the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. After signing with major label DGC Records, the band found breakthrough success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit" from its 
              second album Nevermind (1991).

             			 Following the success of Nevermind, Nirvana was labeled "the flagship band" of Generation X, and Cobain hailed as "the spokesman of a generation". 
              			 Cobain, however, was often uncomfortable and frustrated, believing his message and artistic vision to have been misinterpreted by the public, with his personal issues often subject 
             			 to media attention. He challenged Nirvana's audience with its final studio album In Utero (1993). It did not match the sales figures of Nevermind but was still a critical and commercial success.
						    During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with heroin addiction, illness and depression. He also had difficulty coping with his fame and public image, and the professional and 
				  			 lifelong personal pressures surrounding himself and his wife, musician Courtney Love. On April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead at his home in Seattle, the victim of what was officially ruled a 
				  			 suicide by a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head. The circumstances of his death at age 27 have become a topic of public fascination and debate. Since their debut, Nirvana, with Cobain as a 
				  			 songwriter, has sold over 25 million albums in the US, and over 75 million worldwide.
